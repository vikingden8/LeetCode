### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

#### Description

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given _"abcabcbb"_, the answer is _"abc"_, which the length is _3_.

Given _"bbbbb"_, the answer is _"b"_, with the length of _1_.

Given _"pwwkew"_, the answer is _"wke"_, with the length of _3_. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, _"pwke"_ is a subsequence and not a substring.
